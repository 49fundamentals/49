						The loonie continued to weaken significantly against the US dollar, with CADUSD (sells CAD, buys USD) dropping 7.53% during January to 0.79. Investors are fleeing the currency - down 11.3% y/y - in search of better returns elsewhere. Lower prices for crude oil, a strong US dollar, falling rates and energy-exposed capital markets give little incentive for free-moving capital to shiver in Canadian banks.

						<em>"From the outset of the Great Recession, the BoC has been providing significant monetary stimulus. But we have yet to reach the point where growth is self-sustaining.

						The Bank of Canada surprised markets at its January <a href="http://www.bankofcanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/mpr-2015-01-21.pdf" target="_blank">Monetary Policy Review</a> by unexpectedly lowering the benchmark <a href="http://www.bankofcanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/target_overnight_rate_sept2012.pdf" target="_blank">Overnight Rate</a> a quarter of a percent to 0.75%. Governor Poloz described this rate cut as "insurance" to mitigate the impact that collapsing oil prices will have on Canadian businesses - especially those with exposure to the energy industry. The market has priced in a ~25% chance of a further rate cut in March, and a ~75% chance within the next 6 months.
					</p>
					<p>
						Canadian banks followed suit - though with uncharacteristic delay. The Big Five lowered their prime rates from 3.00% to 2.85%, which is the first time in history that prime shifted by less than 0.25. Some analysts anticipate further cuts to prime in the spring, when housing market demand heats up.

						Prices of crude oil continued to be the main story in energy markets throughout January, with global benchmark Brent Crude falling x.xx% during the month to $x.xx. Sustained OPEC production, surging shale oil output in the USA, and lower expectations of global demand for oil have driven crude prices sharply downwards over the past year.
					</p>
					<p>
						Western Canadian Select's discount to global oil prices continued to narrow, with futures for February delivery trading at a $x.xx(US) discount to WTI. This gap, which exists due to export constraints and inferior quality of product, has shrunk by x.xx% over the past 6 months.
					</p>
					<p>
						Want to speak about oil like a true Canadian? Here's what you need to know: when oil's pricey, we're a proud resource-rich nation; when oil's in the dumps, our economy is an un-diversified pile of liquid dino-bones.

						Plummeting prices for crude oil has placed the Conservative governments commitment to balancing the Federal budget in 2015-2016 under pressure. The government's <em>Economic and Fiscal Projections (Nov 2014)</em> was modelled with oil prices at $81, and was expected to allow for a $3B reserve fund. The Conservatives hoped to pay down federal debt with these monies, but it looks like these reserves will instead be used to cover revenue shortfalls resulting from lower oil prices.
