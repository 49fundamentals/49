						The Canadian dollar continued to weaken significantly against the US dollar, with CADUSD (sells CAD, buys USD) dropping to 0.xx by the end of January. Investors are fleeing the loonie - down xx% y/y - in search of better returns south of the border. Lower nominal crude sales, coupled with low rates and a disappointing stock market give little incentive for free-moving capital to shiver in Canadian banks. Returns are hotter south of 49&deg;.

						Growth in Canada continues to outpace the majority of G7 countries, though forecasts over the past few years have been consistenly over-optimistic.

						"From the outset of the Great Recession, the BoC has been providing significant monetary stimulus. But we have yet to reach the point where grwoth is self-sustaining. For that to happen, the sources of growth will have to rotate away from consumption and toward increased exports, which are our traditional economic engine." - Timothy Lane, Deputy Governor, Bank of Canada

					<p>
						The Bank of Canada surprised markets by unexpectedly lowering the Overnight Rate to 0.75% during its January <a href="http://www.bankofcanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/mpr-2015-01-21.pdf" target="_blank">Monetary Policy Review</a>. Governor Poloz described this rate cut as "insurance" to mitigate against the impact of collapsing oil prices.
					</p>
					<p>
						Canadian banks followed suit - though with uncharacteristic delay. The Big 5 banks lowered their prime rates from 3.00% to 2.85%, which is the first time in history that prime shifted by less than 0.25. RBC said the move reflected "our actual cost of funds and helps clients save money on products such as variable-rate mortgages, lines of credit and floating-rate loans." Some analysts anticipate further cuts to prime in the spring, when housing market demand heats up.

					<p>
						Prices of crude oil continued to be the main story in energy markets throughout January, with global benchmark Brent Crude falling x.xx% during the month to $x.xx. Sustained OPEC production, surging shale oil output in the USA, and lower expectations of global demand for oil have driven crude prices sharply downwards over the past year.
					</p>
					<p>
						Western Canadian Select's discount to global oil prices continued to narrow, with futures for February delivery trading at a $x.xx(US) discount to WTI. This gap, which exists due to export constraints and inferior quality of product, has shrunk by x.xx% over the past 6 months.
					</p>
					<p>
						Want to speak about oil like a true Canadian? Here's what you need to know: when oil's pricey, we're a proud resource-rich nation; when oil's in the dumps, our economy is an un-diversified pile of liquid dino-bones.

					Heavily indebted consumers are benefiting from lower oil prices and downward-trending interest rates. Cheaper gasoline reaches consumers faster than businesses, since corporate buyers generally obtain energy through forward fixed-price contracts.

					12 per cent of Canadian households ahve a total debt-to-income ratio above 250 per cent, and although this percentage has been steady over the past few years, it is almost double the level in 2000. These highly indebted households carry about 40% of overall household debt.

					Automobile-related debt has nearly doubled over the past 8 years, fueled further by low interest rates. As of Q2 2014, about 25% of total auto loans oustanding were non-prime.

December's Financial System Review declared that the Bank sees the probability of a housing market correction to be low, though Governor Stephen Poloz noted that "we don't see ourselves as targeting housing markets in any way."

						In the December 2014 Financial System Review, the BoC identified high household indebtedness, imbalances in the housing market, and increased investor risk-taking as the 3 largest vulnerabilities facing Canada's financial system.
					</p>
					<p>
						In recent months the Federal government has inched closer to the establishment of a national securities regulator, with Ontario and British Columbia signalling their desire to part with the existing 13-regulator system. Canada remains the only major industrialized country without a national capital markets regulator.

						Finance Minister Joe Oliver has pushed the 2015-2016 budget's release date to April 2015, saying that more time was needed to judge the effects of significantly lower oil prices.
					</p>
					<p>
						Plummeting prices for crude oil has placed the Conservative governments commitment to balancing the Federal budget in 2015-2016 under pressure. The government's <em>Economic and Fiscal Projections (Nov 2014)</em> was modelled with oil prices at $81, and was expected to allow for a $3B reserve fund. The Conservatives hoped to pay down federal debt with these monies, but it looks like these reserves will instead be used to cover revenue shortfalls resulting from lower oil prices.

						Below are 2 charts which examine the effect had on the federal budget from 3 different oil-price scenarios.
